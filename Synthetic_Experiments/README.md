# Synthetic Experiment
This directory contains the code used to produce the results from the synthetic experiments and the Figure 2a in the paper.

## Steps to redproduce
To obtain our results we ran the `synthetic_experiments.m` file which will produce a .mat file called `3D_synthetic_results_25MonteCarlo.mat` after the code has finished running. Once it is finished run the `plot_synthetic.m` script which will produce a plot of the average test error for each algorithm.

## Runtime
On our servers this job completed in 3 days 21 hours and 52 minutes. However this may vary depending on your computational power.
